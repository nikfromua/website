<h2>Validation is performed with dynamic pre-rendering of html files so it will allow to construct them with JavaScript on the fly.</h2>

<p>HTML files with 'partial.html' suffix will be ignored, so validator is compatible with dynamic construction of website with html includes like (HTML Data Include)[https://github.com/programmingmentor/html-data-include].</p>
