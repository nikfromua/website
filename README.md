# HTML Template Repository with HTML Proofer

This template repository includes preconfigured GitHub Action that will validate html files in a project with (HTMLProofer)[https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/].

Validation is performed with dynamic pre-rendering of html files so it will allow to construct them with JavaScript on the fly.

HTML files with 'partial.html' suffix will be ignored, so validator is compatible with dynamic construction of website with html includes like (HTML Data Include)[https://github.com/programmingmentor/html-data-include].
